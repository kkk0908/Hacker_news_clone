It&#x27;s beacuse the authors are bad writers.  2) most papers- in bio, I&#x27;d say about 90%- contain invalidating errors which mean that the figures and conclusions are worthless.   It takes skilled readers to uncover methodological flaws (or infer them, as often not all the details are included).<p>After working in bio for a while, it was nice to be in ML because - at least it seemed- I could replicate most papers by downloading the github repo, training on my local GPU for a few days, and then using the trained model to make the same predictions as the papers.  Then I realized- in most cases, what was being claimed was far more than what the trained model was actually capable of doing.<p>Now I stick to well-trod engineering literature that most people consider boring.

I love when authors clearly define a term and use it over and over, because I know exactly what they mean every time. Jargon may be necessary to communicate precisely (but define your jargon, avoid assuming it&#x27;s familiar). E.g. mathematically, there is a difference between a ball and a sphere. And if your L2 ball becomes an L2 balloon in the middle of a proof, readers will be very confused.<p>Also, this is just dead wrong:<p>&gt; Avoid placing equations in the middle of sentences. Mathematics is not the same as English, and we shouldn\u2019t pretend it is.<p>I can see this being useful advice when a proof is full of dense lines of inequalities, but the reasoning is still incorrect. Mathematical notation is nothing more nor less than shorthand for English (or any other language). The following is fine for example: If f(x) &gt;= 1, then either x = 0 or x \\in [1,2].
