I used to do this kind of thing, tracking 5-10 categories and trying to keep them all balanced. For feedback I would periodically assess how things were going in each category and give it a numeric rating, then plot these on a radar chart. The goal was for the resulting shape to be as close to round as possible, i.e. literally well-rounded. If the chart is bulging out in a particular area you&#x27;ve been working hard in, and lagging in another, you could theoretically take that as the signal to switch focus to the area that needs work. Also if you saved the charts over time you could compare the chart from let&#x27;s say January 2019, against the one from January 2018.<p>For me personally it ended up making itself obsolete because it made me notice in a roundabout way that I am, and want to be, one of those people who works better at one thing at a time (or at least, fewer is better).
