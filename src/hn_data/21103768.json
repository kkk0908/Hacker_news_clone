[{"item_id": 21104553, "text": "An interesting challenge is to try to generate this puzzle, or one like it, once you know the answer.<p>Given any existing grid, you can implement a &quot;step&quot; function in code that generates the next grid describing it. You&#x27;ll always find a cycle by stepping over and over (the numbers can never get too high, so the space is finite, so you&#x27;ll always converge to a cycle rather than diverging). The goal, then, is to find a cycle of length 2 (or, better yet, a fixed point that maps to itself).<p>I just coded this up to try it out, and one simple starting point gave a cycle of length 27. I tried randomly generating starting points and I can generate a 3-cycle but haven&#x27;t hit any 2-cycles yet. So maybe there&#x27;s another trick to get the configuration from the puzzle.<p>Edit: nevermind, I misinterpreted the puzzle. All letters in the grid count, so &quot;FOUR F&#x27;S&quot; has two Fs and an S. Accounting for that, a randomized approach quickly finds a 2-cycle. But I guess it&#x27;s interesting that a relatively minor tweak like that has a different outcome.", "by": "alangpierce"}, {"item_id": 21107257, "text": "These squares don&#x27;t describe each other because you need external information, namely of the English language.<p>It&#x27;s like saying that 56 describes a house.
