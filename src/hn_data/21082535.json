[{"item_id": 21101004, "text": "As someone that writes Elixir at $DAYJOB, I was really looking forward to replacing some JS with LiveView. However, after having used it for a simple feature, I&#x27;m not entirely sure if I will continue to use it. I realize it is still pre 1.0 and that there is still a lot of work being done on it.<p>My biggest complaint is that if your server restarts for any reason (say, a rolling restart), you currently lose all state that was on the server[0]. There appears to be some kind of workaround for forms currently, but for anything more complex, I would need to write JS in order to attempt to not have my page get reset to the default view. So if I need to write JS already, I may as well just write JS (or something that transpiles or JS&#x2F;WASM) to have fewer moving parts.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elixirforum.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;liveview-and-rolling-restarts&#x2F;23973\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;elixirforum.com&#x2F;t&#x2F;liveview-and-rolling-restarts&#x2F;2397...</a>", "by": "Ankhers"}, {"item_id": 21101279, "text": "PHP&#x2F;Laravel have something similar to this now called Livewire <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;laravel-livewire.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;laravel-livewire.com&#x2F;</a><p>The author, Caleb Porzio (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calebporzio.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;calebporzio.com&#x2F;</a>), was inspired by Phoenix LiveView to build something something like this for his preferred language&#x2F;framework.", "by": "francislavoie"}, {"item_id": 21100503, "text": "I have been meaning to play around with Elixir, Phoenix and LiveView for a while, it seems like it could replace client-side JS frameworks (e.g. React) for many use cases, especially the ones that already fully use server-side rendering.<p>Has anybody with lots of React experience made that switch?
