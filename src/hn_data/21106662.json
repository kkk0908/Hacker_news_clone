Was born and raised in Germany to a Canadian parent. Have lived and worked in Cologne, Berlin, Mountain View, San Francisco and now Toronto.<p>Some random thoughts and musings that might not matter to you:<p>- All in all, having made the switch from a rather high paying (by German standards) job for a DAX30 company to a Silicon Valley-based US employer in Canada, my gross pay decreased but my take home increased due to significantly lower taxes in Canada. After all taxes and deductions my take home pay in Germany was about 51% of gross, in Canada it is about 67%. On the bottom line I come out about equal due to significantly higher cost of living in Canada, especially Toronto.\nMy groceries spend is factor 2.5, my rent spend is factor 4.5, internet at home is factor 2, cell phone is factor 3 compared to Germany.\nPretty much everything but clothes is much more expensive in Canada.<p>- Also the availability of things through online shops or stores is very different. In Germany we have Services such as Geizhals.de which allows you to compare prices on very specific items across hundreds of online stores. Amazon is usually not the cheapest or best option.\nIn Canada, Amazon is usually the only option. Or ordering from the US and paying duties and fees. This is especially true if you into crafty or electrical engineering things (parts and materials).<p>- As a visible minority Berlin is going to be fine (if not great!). Other parts of Germany might be less pleasant. I believe physically you&#x27;d be safer in Berlin that you&#x27;d be in Toronto due to overall significantly lower gun violence.<p>- Depending on how the US administration goes the TN visa might not be a long term option. It certainly isn&#x27;t, even today, if you plan to stay in the US long term.<p>- Banking in the US and Canada are horrible when compared to the EU. Also: The German credit score system is basically the inverse of the US&#x2F;Canadian system. Nothing on your file == good.<p>- I personally like winters. Toronto gets lots of snow, Berlin I find to be exceptionally cold and damp during winters but rarely it gets snow. I prefer snow over dampness.<p>- 24 days of paid leave is the legal minimum for a full time position at 6 days per week, 20 days if you work 5 days a week in Germany.

This is useful for socialising after work. There are a LOT of talks and conferences that happen in Berlin.<p>However as a lot of people are transitory, moving in and out of the city, I found it difficult making more longer-term relationships. I don&#x27;t think Berlin is unique in that regards, rather I think it is a trait shared by other large cities. I think it can be reinforcing: people are reluctant to invest in deep relationships as people move so often, and people move when they haven&#x27;t formed relationships.<p>At times Berlin felt a bit like living on an island, as it is far away from clusters of other major cities in Germany. Deutsche Bahn did open a new line between Berlin and Munich, however, so now you can go to Oktoberfest in 4 hours.<p>German industry is also more located in West Germany, rather than the East. However what I did see was the big companies opening up subsidiaries in Berlin.

This can be significantly more expensive, however. Berlin is not that cheap any more.<p>As an immigrant, I bought a furnished apartment with a 3 month let from a specialist company (who obviously charge a premium). This allowed me to get my official German papers, such as a SCHUFA check (a piece of paper that says you don&#x27;t have any debt) that allowed me to rent a &quot;real&quot; place. In the 3 months I could also get the bank account, town registration, etc. documents you also need.<p>However, as I mentioned, if I were to do it again, I would have probably just tried to pay a premium to get a furnished place, longer term.

The path to citizenship is also straightforward.<p>Interestingly, there aren\u2019t that many Indians in Berlin, or at least I would say I see more Indians on the street in Budapest than in Berlin, and I would probably have expected the opposite.  There\u2019s probably an \u201cIndian scene\u201d in Berlin but there definitely isn\u2019t good Indian food.  In Berlin the \u201cAsians\u201d are mostly from Vietnam.<p>One thing you should think seriously about if you\u2019re looking at settling in Germany is Munich.  Munich is where the higher-paying tech jobs are.  Less startup culture, more good old fashioned German profit-making actual legitimate business culture.  Google, Apple, Microsoft \u2014 these companies have a much bigger presence in Munich than in Berlin.<p>There is still quite a bit of specialization in German cities.  Publishing? Hamburg.  Finance? Frankfurt.  Cars? Munich, or Stuttgart and environs.  Basically if you want to live a dynamic and interesting and vibrant life, and are cool with making less money, go to Berlin.  If you want more stability and professionalism go somewhere else.  And it\u2019s really easy to travel around Germany by train, plane or automobile, so you can always start in one place and explore others.  Check out Darmstadt for example!  Amazing art museum! Very very serious tech research scene!  Minutes from Frankfurt!<p>Another thing to consider is that German employment culture revolves around stability.  There are lots of opportunities to do weird risky things, but in principle almost everybody thinks the best way to live is to have a good job, do your work, and by the time you\u2019re 30 you have a pretty good idea what your life will be like when you retire at 67.  If that\u2019s attractive to you, you\u2019ll probably really love Germany.<p>And as long as you\u2019re in Berlin or Munich or Hamburg you don\u2019t have to eat German food! :-)<p>Finally, one thing I think German \u201ctech\u201d doesn\u2019t get enough credit for: there is a lot of very serious engineering done in Germany but it\u2019s not the \u201cUber for X\u201d variety \u2014 it\u2019s mostly based around existing, real-world technical challenges, usually involving physical machines of some kind.  If things like self-driving cars or factory automation or building a better hammer attract you more than \u201cSocial network for cats\u201d then you\u2019ll probably really like German engineering culture.", "by": "biztos"}, {"item_id": 21107140, "text": "interesting, that you say salaries in Berlin are higher than in Toronto. i always thought it was other way around. can someone give ballpark numbers about Berlin fulltime and contract rates?", "by": "shitgoose"}, {"item_id": 21107457, "text": "As an immigrant from India who is happily living in Toronto with no desire of going (back) to US, here are my reasons why I like it here better. My reasons have nothing to do with job opportunities. (I lived in NY for about 8 years ).<p>As a &quot;visible minority&quot;, life in Toronto and Vancouver is less stressful than it is in USA or Edmonton. Also your dating life will be better in Toronto. If you plan to have a family and kids, you don&#x27;t have to worry about school shootings -- this is now a thing parents worry about in USA. Your parents can visit you and getting a visitor visa is not a pain.<p>Of course taxes are higher and take home pay is lower than in USA and the rent is too damm high. But somehow your quality of life will be better here. People are more chill here than in USA (my experience is limited to NY&#x2F;NJ) and I will bet you already have someone you know who has relative living in Canada. So loneliness will not be an issue.<p>Also, you can start your own business as soon as you get permanent residency. in USA, a green card could take upto 12 years. In Canada , you will get it in 3 years at most. And when you start contracting as  an independent , you will make a whole lot more.<p>I have never been to Berlin but I hope to visit it one day. I have German friends and they are wonderful people.", "by": "manishsharan"}]
