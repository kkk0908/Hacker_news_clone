[{"item_id": 21111967, "text": "Excellent post.<p>A lot of this rings true to my experiences as well, particularly being defensive about time and commitments. Really, most of the authors points had me kind of nodding along.<p>On the other hand, I somewhat feel what the author is getting at with optimism, but I&#x27;m not sure optimism is the right word for what makes me productive. It&#x27;s difficult to put into words, but I do agree there is a kind of strange attitude adjustment that has to happen.<p>You need to reach a point where you decide you&#x27;re going to do something, regardless of what problems come up, or how long it takes. There are problems in my own projects that I know I&#x27;ll need to solve, and I don&#x27;t currently know the solutions, but I know I&#x27;ll come up with solutions for them, and whatever I need to do to pragmatically solve them will just need to happen. It&#x27;s less about me feeling confident in myself, and more just saying, &quot;well, I care about the outcome, and I don&#x27;t care what I need to figure out in order to get there.&quot; I know I&#x27;ll put in the time, or find the resources, or learn, or give up whatever I need to give up to make it happen.<p>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d call that optimism though. It almost feels a bit more like stubbornness, or defiance. It&#x27;s not just an assumption that things are going to work out.", "by": "danShumway"}]
