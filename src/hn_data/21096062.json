I was old enough to know not to stare, but I wanted to, and couldn&#x27;t help but do a sly double-take. She was bluish. No other way to describe it. No one there to witness it ever seemed to believe me (not that I can blame them), but it was a few years later that I learned the name of the family and did some research.
