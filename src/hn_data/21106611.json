[{"item_id": 21111481, "text": "I had an idea for a minimal change to improve a Reddit-like site, perhaps you will find it interesting: split the concept of &quot;subreddit&quot; into &quot;tags&quot; and &quot;communities&quot;.<p>Tags: much of the content of Reddit is people reposting the same thing at various times to various subreddits, and many of the comments are people noticing that it fits into &quot;r&#x2F;whatever&quot; instead. The default behavior should be that posts of the same link to various tags (r&#x2F;awww, r&#x2F;catsstandingup) should not recreate a new post but just backlink to the same post. Repeat posts to the same tag should be a no-operation. This removes the community aspect of tags, and some of the worst emergent behaviors of reddit along with it. Treating a tag as both a topic and a community leads to a neverending cycle of people creating niche topic tags for the community aspect, but then finding themselves &quot;invaded&quot; as people will always want to find and comment on content about topics that they disagree with.<p>But of course the community aspect of Reddit leads to good things. So you make a separate concept of communities. These communities could follow the posts of one or more tags, applying filters to those of their own choosing, and make their discussion visible within community borders only or visible to all, based on their own choices (in addition to internal community posts.) They can control admission to the communities on their own rules (fully public, invite codes only, etc.) The ability to automatically follow the posts of certain tags (and either view or not view public comments) will keep small communities from getting stale for lack of posts.", "by": "comnetxr"}, {"item_id": 21110903, "text": "How will you avoid-<p>&gt; John Gabriel&#x27;s Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory was proposed in the Penny Arcade (web comic) on March 19, 2004 by Mike Krahulik and Jerry Holkins.

It&#x27;s also a good thing that (it appears that) this website is &quot;fresh&quot; and apolitical rather than coming forth from a political rift in another community (e.g. 8chan, gab, voat).<p>I&#x27;ll definitely be following this website with interest; I&#x27;m a huge fan of sites that allow anonymous posting as well as how Reddit can create active communities around very niche topics (which is a lot harder on e.g. 4chan).<p>EDIT: I do have some problems with this rule: &quot;Nothing that violates US law, or anything that would be considered &#x27;gray area&#x27;.&quot; What is a &#x27;gray area&#x27; is, itself, a gray area.
