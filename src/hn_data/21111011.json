It then obsessively pursues the meaning of life through ever larger art projects, some reaching planetary scale. It eventually concludes it has found the meaning of life and in it&#x27;s final art project it disables all it&#x27;s higher cognitive functions and &quot;downgrades&quot; itself back to it&#x27;s original tile scrubbing form with just enough awareness left to take pleasure in the singular menial task.<p>EDIT: I just found out it was adapted from a book called Zima Blue and Other Stories by Alastair Reynolds", "by": "PinkMilkshake"}, {"item_id": 21111256, "text": "The author did not do a good job of spelling out the differences in the two types of happiness. In fact, she didn&#x27;t even address them by their proper names (hedonic and eudaimonic). Identifying the two and really digging in on their differences would probably have made for a more interesting article - and certainly a more enlightening one. Just saying &quot;people are unhappy, don&#x27;t confuse unhappy with unjoyful&quot; isn&#x27;t enough. (Spoiler alert: people think they want hedonic when what they&#x27;re really seeking is eudaimonic.)<p>We&#x27;re driven to hedonic happiness to which  the article loosely alludes just by having stuff and labels that say to be happy. While short term satisfactory it does nothing for people long term. Eudaimonic happiness is a deeper, almost stoic-like approach to happiness. It involves being a part of something that has potential of outlasting the individual. From my experience it took a while to get to this point and understanding the real differences and putting into practices the ceremonies that go with it.<p>One little trick that I learned a while back: never say &quot;I have to&quot; when you can say &quot;I get to&quot;. For example it&#x27;s not &quot;I have to help a friend move&quot; it&#x27;s &quot;I get to help a friend move&quot;. It turned from a chore to a treat - and it is a treat because I get to spend time with my friend. Yeah, it&#x27;s hot, physically exhausting, and all you get at the end of the day is pizza and beer, but at the end of the day _you get pizza and beer_ which is better than 99% of the rest of the world.

It\u2019s what\u2019s there when you remove the sense that something is missing in your life. We are highly judgmental, survival, and replication machines. We are constantly walking around thinking I need this, I need that, trapped in the web of desires. Happiness is that state when nothing is missing.

I&#x27;m not sure when precisely it happened, but &quot;happiness&quot; got a lot harder to find as soon as humanity hypostatized it and made it into a psuedo-religious concept and the end all-be-all of life--seems like everyone just want&#x27;s to &quot;be happy&quot;. Unfortunately, &quot;happiness&quot; is not concrete--it&#x27;s a lazy stand-in for the goals you ought to actually be setting for yourself. The point of life is not to &quot;be happy&quot;--happiness is a pleasant side effect of the life well-lived, not its telos.<p>Pursue something concrete. Set a measurable goal. Aim for small things. Remove the term &quot;happy&quot; from your vocabulary. Just be and do, and focus on things that are small, well defined, modest and not amorphous. Cast aside your distractions. Choose an identity for yourself. Write the obituary you&#x27;d want to have. Work toward it. Fulfill your being. All of a sudden, you might feel a certain nonchalance, a certain comfortability, you might find that you can get on just fine without fretting so much. Over time, your worries might even start to dissipate.<p>Oh, and stop spending so much time consuming and start spending more time producing, crucially, <i>for yourself</i> or for your loved ones, not for an employer. When you interact with other people, use your brain, don&#x27;t turn it off. Think about them in a serious, focused way. Be present. Contemplate moments. Give good gifts. Break from patterns. Don&#x27;t be afraid of embarrassment, corniness, or sentiment.
