[{"item_id": 21100352, "text": "IMO this post has some good points but makes the executive sound like a passive referee, ultimately misunderstanding what High Output Management (also one of my favorite books!) is about. (Admittedly adding my own editorial here from my experience founding a startup and now running it as a ~3,000-person public company.)<p>The basic principle of HOM is that the fundamental job of an executive is to deliver results (&quot;output&quot;), and that the measure of an executive is the output of their organization. Importantly, there is no one right way to deliver results -- successful CEOs can have very different styles and techniques.<p>That said, for every effective way to deliver results there are vastly more that are ineffective. Complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty are not your friends. Time is not your friend. Everything is situationally dependent. There are many skills to develop and principles that can help but there&#x27;s no formula.<p>This also partially explains why the median CEO or exec is perceived as ineffective, often because they are. It&#x27;s a hard job, otherwise everyone would do it well and there would be a surplus of good (and cheap) execs.<p>Contrary to what the post suggests, HOM does not say not that the job of an executive is to wave some kind of magic culture or &quot;values&quot; wand and rubber-stamp whatever emergent strategy and behavior results from that. CEOs and executives absolutely do (and must) make important decisions of all kinds, break ties, and set general direction. Occasionally they need to give commands but more typically you work collaboratively with and (as the post correctly suggests) empower your team and avoid doing too much as an individual contributor.<p>If you&#x27;re curious about what execs do and how to be a good one, HOM is an incredible book. The Effective Executive by Drucker is another favorite.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;what-only-the-ceo-can-do\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2009&#x2F;05&#x2F;what-only-the-ceo-can-do</a> is one of my favorite articles about the responsibilities of the CEO.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-leaders-calendar\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;hbr.org&#x2F;2018&#x2F;07&#x2F;the-leaders-calendar</a> is a fascinating study of where CEOs spend their time and what they actually do day to day.", "by": "dhouston"}, {"item_id": 21095977, "text": "Well, I&#x27;m not going to argue much with Andy Grove.  But my answer to &quot;What do executives do?&quot; is: Work on environmental problems.<p>Problems can be put into three buckets: 1) Can be solved by things 100% under your control. 2) Can be solved only by influencing others to participate, 3) Things that are part of the environment and can really only be mitigated.<p>Area 1, control, is the realm of the first line manager.  The FLM has the people, the budget, the FLM&#x27;s team has the know-how, so execute well and the problem is solved.<p>Area 2, influence, is the realm of the middle manager, and also sales and marketing.  You need to borrow resources from somebody else, argue for corporate re-allocation of resources, convince a sales prospect to become a customer, etc.<p>Area 3, environment, is the realm of the executive.  You have no control and no influence, unless you can <i>find</i> some levers and then delegate.  But some things will not have obvious levers.  Example: It rains.  No body will stop the rain.  But everyone can fix the holes in their roof. Likewise, companies have competitors and an economic environment in which they operate.  Predict and make plans.<p>When I was at Intel, one of the great things that senior Mids got to participate in was &quot;red teaming&quot; as competitors. Given all that Intel knew about a competitor, a team would be give a data dump and a short number of weeks to come up with a strategic plan for that competitor to Eat Intel&#x27;s Lunch.  Then they presented to Intel executive staff.  From what I heard, it was an excellent experience all around and very valuable to the company.  (Before you ask, no....

It&#x27;s interesting to think that it&#x27;s not the role of the exec team to set strategy, and the issue may have been with the management layer below the exec team.

Below is a different take on senior executives that may help shed light on why some things are the way they are.<p>To become a senior executive, the individual must often pass through many trials and tribulations which entails risk taking. A portion of that comes with taking a leap into different verticals, inheriting and resolving other people&#x27;s mess, taking a strategic perspective on things, etc. But you must think, &quot;other&#x27;s also have to go through that&quot; and it is true, but for potential and new executives, it tends to happen more often and at a greater risk to the self and the organization. The risk they take also needs to account for competition, time without family&#x2F;friends, emphasis in the company not in the self, etc. All of these are risks, and when compounded can increase the compensation value of an executive. If the market functioned differently it is likely that a lot less people would be interested in taking that jump, specially in today&#x27;s economy, where most computer &amp; IT occupations have a similar median pay than a top executive [1][2] (USA numbers).<p>As they become the 0.01% of the 0.01% in their area of expertise, they are able to command better compensation for their time. By being part of that equation, you often have to jump into publicly traded companies and become a public figure (internally &amp; externally) which is viewed as a premium in market led opportunities (artists, sports players, etc).<p>A simpler way to visualize the demand aspect of it is to ask yourself: If you had $1m, would you prefer to put it in the hands of someone with reputation or in the hands of the average Joe passing by? Would you pay $300k to get the best doctor to treat your illness with a 5% higher odds of survival or would you be fine to do it with someone else for $50k?<p>Of course, there are still questions regarding market distortions, cronyism and many others that should be taken into account and potentially acted upon to create what society perceives to be fair.
