Around 9% survive five years or more -- a number that hasn&#x27;t really changed.<p>In a belt plus suspenders move I underwent 2 rounds (six infusions per round) of chemo plus 28 consecutive weekdays of radiation after surgery.  All my doctors are amazed at my recovery, a few saying the best they&#x27;ve seen (though it came with diabetes and a different digestive pathway).<p>Chemo was awful.  Mine came with a bag of steroids first to mask the effects for a few days.  I scheduled my sessions for Thursday, knowing it wouldn&#x27;t hit me until Friday night.  One Saturday I slept around 20 hours.<p>However, by the end we had figured out how to minimize the effect of the chemo.  I needed my wife who watched me diligently.  Cancer is not a one person job!  She made sure every time I opened my eyes I stayed hydrated and ate something.<p>Chemo should have gotten worse.  It actually got easier.<p>My cancer never caused me pain.  The treatment... that&#x27;s another story.

Cancer cells grow rapidly (part of what makes them dangerous). So the toxic effect gets the cancer cells first, since cells that are growing take up the most chemotherapy. But other cells grow rapidly too, like hair and intestinal cells, which is why cancer patients lose their hair and have terrible nausea&#x2F;diarrhea.<p>All (almost all?) cells take up some chemo. So, you are actually dying, just hopefully more slowly than the cancer. And then we stop the chemo before you all the way die.<p>This is why the bar for a cancer diagnosis is so high.

The more common and no less serious side effects of heart muscle damage and secondary leukemia are not mentioned in the tagline, being ill-suited as click bait I presume.<p>I have given the chemotherapy described here to many patients. There is wide variation in how patients experience chemotherapy. Some finish and tell me it wasn&#x27;t as bad as they expected. I&#x27;m quite sure they only tell me things like this in the privacy of the consulting room. They would never say this to another patient in the waiting room. They feel bad for not having had the kind of widely publicised terrible experience.<p>Beyond the tagline, the account is reasonably accurate, although at times indulges in melodrama, about mitochondria of all things. It also doesn&#x27;t do a good job of talking about the cognitive dysfunction associated with chemotherapy. This is a complex issue. In randomised trials, patients receiving placebo cancer treatments tend to report high rates of some cognitive problems. That chemotherapy itself is causal in every case is certainly in doubt. The mere experience of being diagnosed with cancer as you might imagine can have profound cognitive effects.<p>I am not quibbling for the sake of it. There are patients who decide not to have chemotherapy, and sometimes what they have heard about the experience from &#x27;alternate&#x27; channels (such as newspaper taglines) has an out-sized influence on their decision. This is why a responsible editorial team would have had this article reviewed by medical professionals and patient advocates, and taken their advice about more judicious highlighting of potential side-effects. The article also doesn&#x27;t quite deal with the fact that triple negative breast cancer is a really bad disease to have. Metastatic disease has a median overall survival of 18 months. If chemotherapy had not completely eradicated the cancer as it did in her case (the chances are about 50-50), 40% of patients develop metastatic disease in 3 years.", "by": "Gatsky"}, {"item_id": 21104152, "text": "Chemotherapy is scary. It seems so counterintuitive to choose to inflict this kind of damage to oneself, in the hopes that it will prevent an even worse outcome.<p>Part of it is that there is this nagging feeling that it might not even be the right approach, given the legion of side effects of all kinds. Even oncologists get vague and evasive when this is questioned. In the end we can only rely on generalized statistics about survival rates, unsure of how it applies to individual situations.<p>I disagree with the anger people often show towards cancer. It&#x27;s like people project some kind of malignant personality onto the phenomenon. I think of it as a natural part of life, like early hair loss. You can die from it, but death comes anyway, for one reason or another. At least with cancer you have time to get used to the idea, unlike an accident, heart attack or whatever.
