As a result, these additional wages are neither reinvested, nor reflected in the disposable income of employees. This is the dynamic behind the mystery of stagnant wages. When workers in a particularly well-paid sector begin pouring into a city, landlords likewise raise the rent to absorb these incomes. It isn\u2019t gentrification, but absorption through monopoly power.\u201d<p>The housing affordability crisis is really a crisis of land owner cartels, especially in major urban centers.

We have the same issues of low productivity and relatively low wages as well.<p>There&#x27;s a toxic cycle that&#x27;s created. Boomers made all of their money in housing appreciation, and heavily encourage millennials to continue the cycle (which, taking the most optimistic view of it all, makes sense). But a house doesn&#x27;t cost 2.5x your income now - it costs 8-10x. So you&#x27;re married to a mortgage (which unlike America has its interest rate fixed for &lt;5 years), have probably got a lot of your parents money invested as well (because you aren&#x27;t earning enough to come up with a $200k down payment on your own).<p>Because real estate has &#x27;proven&#x27; results, and the media make a lot of money advertising houses for sale, that&#x27;s a lot of what you get told to do. As an individual you&#x27;re so heavily indebted you can&#x27;t afford to take risks, but at the same time, companies aren&#x27;t trying to improve their productivity - because the best ROI has been in the property market.
