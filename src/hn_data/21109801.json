And I&#x27;m putting my position there specifically because I want to appeal to that demographic. This is also why, for instance, in times past if you stayed at home and watched broadcast television there would be a disproportionate number of ads for things such as tampons, diapers (adult and child alike), and job injury lawyers. It was targeting the demographic watching television at that time.<p>Perhaps one fair solution here would be an opt-in demographic profile override. What a mouth full. What I mean is that if you want, you can require Facebook to set your demographics to whatever you like. In other words, imagine you&#x27;re a woman and you want to be shown ads targeting men, well you can opt-in to require your account profile to be a hit for man or woman.<p>The curious thing is that I imagine almost nobody would actually choose to opt-in there. It&#x27;d probably be more used as a protest tool to destroy the value of advertising (by large numbers of people opting into everything), than a tool to get more ads you&#x27;re interested in.
