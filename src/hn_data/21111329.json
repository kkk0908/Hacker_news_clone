Also if this takes off and the trade war ends at some point it will drive down prices which is always good. This will also drive the tech needed to mine and refine the materials. An example would be the shale gas production in the US. When it stated the tech said you had to be at $80-100 per barrel and now it is as low at $30 (for good or bad).", "by": "myrandomcomment"}, {"item_id": 21111856, "text": "They should also set up a national reserve of that stuff.

This trade war is never going to end until China is reduced to such a level that it can no longer fight and gives up and joins the world order as a subordinate state. I don&#x27;t think China&#x27;s confidence is broken to such a level that it surrenders. So this is probably the only move to make going forward.
