[{"item_id": 21104022, "text": "I\u2019ve always thought that one of the most important parts of the human experience is the freedom of forgetting, at least on a personal level. To forget things is a gift in many cases. To forget hurt, embarrassment, or feelings of negativity in general. But this article makes me wonder how that belief works in a broader context, like in a culture, or country. Is it right to also forget things like periods of historical violence? Is it right to gradually lose our memories of symbols once associated with hate? Maybe 80 years is too short a period of time to forget these things (like the swastika\u2019s association with The Third Reich), but I\u2019m sure as a species we\u2019ve forgotten similar symbology from thousands of years ago, or hundreds. Should we try to make that our goal?<p>Im not sure, I\u2019m just riffing while bored on my phone, but it also makes me wonder if there are clear examples of symbols of evil being retrofitted to be symbols of good, or at least neutral standing. It always seems to be that we try to erase these symbols, but never pull them out of the depths of immorality.<p>\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_&#x2F;\u00af", "by": "sweetheart"}, {"item_id": 21103070, "text": "Semiotics is ever lurking.", "by": "hprotagonist"}, {"item_id": 21103800, "text": null, "by": null}]
