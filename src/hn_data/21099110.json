[{"item_id": 21099418, "text": "Congratulations to the EU commission and the EU parliament on achieving the exact opposite of what they wanted to do despite being told this would happen and despite it actually already happening in Spain and Germany. It&#x27;s not like this is any kind of surprise, it&#x27;s the only logical thing that could&#x27;ve happened. I am still extremely bitter about the dirty way this  law was passed, the lies, the deliberate lies by the commission, the nasty response EU politicians had at protesters and the absolute contempt they had for young people saying they we&#x27;re entitled children trained by internet giants to expect free things. I watched the debates in parliament and there were MEPs who actually said that. The horsetrading France and Germany did over Russian gas in order to get a deal on this law. That disgusting blog post the EU commission published calling people who disagreed with them bots and brainwashed and positioning themselves literally as knights out to slay the google dragon. It&#x27;s all horribly corrupt and cynical. I&#x27;m  sure many young people got the message that their leaders view them with such absolute contempt and open hatred and I fear the consequences for Europe.", "by": "pavelludiq"}, {"item_id": 21099449, "text": "I really wish traditional news media, aka those people that are supposed to dissaminate the news, would get a grip and stop breaking the internet and their core business altogether one of these days. If you lose revenue because google shows a few sentences of the introduction your content is not worth it to readers. But no, instead of better content and easier ways to consume it, we get more clickbait and whining about fake news.<p>At least on the level of local newspapers in Germany it&#x27;s a complete disaster for me personally. It&#x27;s not even that I wouldn&#x27;t want to pay people that go out and report on local happenings, it&#x27;s just that I don&#x27;t want to add another 10-20EUR subscription for the 1&#x2F;2 articles I&#x27;d want to skim that&#x27;s actually relevant content and not some made up outrage or simply agency content.", "by": "tastroder"}, {"item_id": 21099434, "text": "Users will have less incentive to click on links without a little preview.

What this means for content creators is that you couldn\u2019t make revenue.<p>If I search for something on Google I get so much information above the fold (and ads), I pretty much never see a real site. That\u2019s a serious issue, because Google isn\u2019t creating that content. Worse, their using their monopoly to push the AMP framework to make it easier to get snippets and actually serve your content on their servers.<p>No, this doesn\u2019t have to be the end of the world.
