For me, plausibility is really important when creating any fictional map, because it&#x27;s possible to create a map that looks beautiful but depicts a place that doesn&#x27;t really make sense even with fantasy elements incorporated.<p>The color scheme of the political map is highly distinctive but feels cohesive. There&#x27;s a decent phonetic&#x2F;orthographic consistency in the naming within a state. The religions layer doesn&#x27;t feel particularly integrated with the political one, for instance I found a theocracy without an organized religion.<p>The geography is also pretty good. Rivers are one of the telltale signs of poor fantasy map building, but this makes pretty believable rivers, though I did find a case of an inland sea draining into itself. It&#x27;s good the mountains form ranges, but it would be interesting to have some more evidence of volcanism. I found one map with a huge area filled with mountains in an unrealistic way but I had a fun time imagining how it may have gotten that way in a fantasy world.<p>I really like that it has some climate generation and I&#x27;d love to see more, things like prevailing winds, winter&#x2F;summer variation, and more of a K\u00f6ppen climate classification[0] than the biomes currently listed, but I know this is a fantasy map generator and those require parameterizing more the nature of the planet being mapped.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;K\u00f6ppen_climate_classification</a>", "by": "cjhveal"}, {"item_id": 21099735, "text": "This blog is amazing as well:<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heredragonsabound.blogspot.com&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;heredragonsabound.blogspot.com&#x2F;</a><p>The latest entry is about the mentioned map generator by the way.
