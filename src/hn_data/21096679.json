If done well this is <i>extremely</i> time consuming.<p>- Finally, the Journals have the temerity to charge the same universities who produce their product <i>millions</i> of pounds a year in journal subscriptions and Open Access fees.<p>- Finally finally, none of the Authors are <i>ever</i> paid for their work.

But like all power, there are those who want to keep it for \nthemselves. The world&#x27;s entire scientific and cultural heritage, published over centuries \nin books and journals, is increasingly being digitized and locked up by a handful of \nprivate corporations. Want to read the papers featuring the most famous results of the \nsciences? You&#x27;ll need to send enormous amounts to publishers like Reed Elsevier.<p>There are those struggling to change this. The Open Access Movement has fought \nvaliantly to ensure that scientists do not sign their copyrights away but instead ensure \ntheir work is published on the Internet, under terms that allow anyone to access it. But \neven under the best scenarios, their work will only apply to things published in the future. \nEverything up until now will have been lost.<p>That is too high a price to pay. Forcing academics to pay money to read the work of their \ncolleagues? Scanning entire libraries but only allowing the folks at Google to read them? \nProviding scientific articles to those at elite universities in the First World, but not to \nchildren in the Global South? It&#x27;s outrageous and unacceptable.<p>&quot;I agree,&quot; many say, &quot;but what can we do? The companies hold the copyrights, they \nmake enormous amounts of money by charging for access, and it&#x27;s perfectly legal \u2014 \nthere&#x27;s nothing we can do to stop them.&quot; But there is something we can, something that&#x27;s \nalready being done: we can fight back.<p>Those with access to these resources \u2014 students, librarians, scientists \u2014 you have been \ngiven a privilege. You get to feed at this banquet of knowledge while the rest of the world \nis locked out. But you need not \u2014 indeed, morally, you cannot \u2014 keep this privilege for \nyourselves. You have a duty to share it with the world. And you have: trading passwords \nwith colleagues, filling download requests for friends.<p>Meanwhile, those who have been locked out are not standing idly by. You have been \nsneaking through holes and climbing over fences, liberating the information locked up by \nthe publishers and sharing them with your friends.<p>But all of this action goes on in the dark, hidden underground. It&#x27;s called stealing or \npiracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a \nship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn&#x27;t immoral \u2014 it&#x27;s a moral imperative. Only \nthose blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.<p>Large corporations, of course, are blinded by greed. The laws under which they operate \nrequire it \u2014 their shareholders would revolt at anything less. And the politicians they \nhave bought off back them, passing laws giving them the exclusive power to decide who \ncan make copies.<p>There is no justice in following unjust laws. It&#x27;s time to come into the light and, in the \ngrand tradition of civil disobedience, declare our opposition to this private theft of public \nculture.<p>We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with \nthe world. We need to take stuff that&#x27;s out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need \nto buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific \njournals and upload them to file sharing networks. We need to fight for Guerilla Open \nAccess.<p>With enough of us, around the world, we&#x27;ll not just send a strong message opposing the \nprivatization of knowledge \u2014 we&#x27;ll make it a thing of the past.
