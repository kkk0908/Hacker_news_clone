Experiments found a similar longterm potentiation mechanism in the vertical lobe of octopuses.<p>Quoting the article: &quot;The discovery of LTP in octopuses provides evidence for convergent evolution that has led to the selection of similar synaptic activity. Though not yet agreed upon in the scientific community, the existence of LTP in both mammals and octopuses strengthens the concept of LTP as a cellular basis for learning and memory and may be a general mechanism for associative learning&quot;.", "by": "irwt"}, {"item_id": 21083428, "text": "Good read!
