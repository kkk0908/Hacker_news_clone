Grandpa would eat a half grapefruit every morning, believing that the acidity would alkalize one&#x27;s system in response and lead (along with frequent alternative chelation treatments) to better health. We didn&#x27;t drink the chelation shakes, but we did eat the grapefruits, since they were there and prepared.<p>Over the two-week visit, my brother got harder and harder to be around - he&#x27;d always been surly, and he struggled with grandpa&#x27;s wife, but we&#x27;d never experienced the level of emotional turmoil he went through on that trip. He self-harmed, sliced his arms up deeply. I stitched him up with the sewing kit that the resort had mercifully left in the room for us, and we kept the wounds dressed with neosporin until they healed.<p>The next stop on the trip was a visit to grandpa&#x27;s wife&#x27;s sister, a professor of neuroscience. She just happened to mention the interaction between antipsychotics and grapefruit, and it was like a light went on in my brother&#x27;s mind. He stopped eating grapefruit and returned to his usual mental state within a few days.", "by": "presidentender"}, {"item_id": 21112072, "text": "One thing glossed over in these articles is that the impact is mostly on this enzyme as it exists in the intestines.<p>There\u2019s less impact on this enzyme as it exists elsewhere in the body (primarily the liver).", "by": "Scoundreller"}, {"item_id": 21108224, "text": "Interesting to see this now.
