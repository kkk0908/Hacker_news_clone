This is in contrast to a more normal layout that will typically pitch up.<p>On the conventional layout this means that the horizontal stabilisers at the back need to produce a downwards&#x2F;negative lift to stabilise the plane.<p>The X-29 has canards at the front that have to produce positive lift to balance the plane. This means it&#x27;s actually more efficient as both surfaces are producing useful lift and avoiding the penalty of the negative lift of traditional horizontal stabilisers.<p>This is of course more complex in practice, with the CoG not being in a fixed position and careful positioning of wings to reduce the pitch-up tendency.", "by": "agurk"}, {"item_id": 21108987, "text": "&quot;But its highly experimental design made it the most aerodynamically unstable aircraft ever built.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s true.
