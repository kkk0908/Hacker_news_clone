You should avoid using Wikipedia when things like the SEP[1] and IEP[2] are available. Also, &quot;probabilistic&quot; fallacies are <i>not</i> formal fallacies. E.g. something like the &quot;gambler&#x27;s fallacy&quot; is not a de facto formal logical fallacy.<p>Further, the &quot;Naturalistic Fallacy&quot; isn&#x27;t what you think it is. There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;argument from nature&quot; or &quot;the appeal to nature&quot; (which is what you think it is), and G.E. Moore&#x27;s Naturalistic Fallacy[3].
