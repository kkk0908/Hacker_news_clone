I&#x27;ll test with that for the shits and giggles off it.

Told setup NO to all the extra&#x27;s (location, personal ad&#x27;s etc etc etc) and the install took using the existing local account and didn&#x27;t prompt me to &quot;upgrade&quot; to an MS account.<p>As for real hardware I upgraded a friend of the families laptop 2 weeks ago from 7 to 10 using the media creation tool and it again upgraded without pestering for an MS account. (And I&#x27;ll be upgrading another in the next week or two when they are ready for me to do it.
