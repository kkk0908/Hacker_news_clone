There I visualize people as molecules in a gas. They tend to distribute evenly. However the passages between cars are high-friction so pressure differences show there. As I walk between cars I can gauge the pressure differential and whether it&#x27;s sensible to continue walking that direction.<p>For the parking lot it would have to be a column of air.
