[{"item_id": 21105741, "text": "I think these articles and the responses are missing the real point which is how an Ivy League education became so important in America.<p>I grew up in Israel near the Technion, our MIT equivalent which produced a few Nobel Prize winners. It&#x27;s not a big deal to get in, if you have poor high school scores you take a year long prep course, classes are hard but most people push through. Having a Technion degree might give you a slight edge getting your first job but that&#x27;s that - you&#x27;ll be judged by your performance moving on, not on your alma mater.<p>When I lived in the US for a few years, I couldn&#x27;t understand how people allocate such importance to a person&#x27;s high school performance (which is basically what determines their alma mater in the best case scenario, before family donations etc). To me it signals a risk-averse mentality that fears taking a chance on a potential hire.", "by": "nir"}, {"item_id": 21104804, "text": "When I was an undergrad Prof. Joe Traub (famous for applying Quasi Monte Carlo to derivatives) passed away and they had a whole lecture series in memorium.

In the past it did. Fighting inequality or discrimination, especially at the professional level, started when someone said, &quot;Okay, I&#x27;m just going to make a school for my own then.&quot; My favorite example of this is the dismantling of Jewish exclusion at New York medical schools, which happened by creating new medical schools that did not discriminate.
