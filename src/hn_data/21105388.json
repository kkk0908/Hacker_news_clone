Obviously we would never make such a decision now, but it gives a special context to today&#x27;s safety decisions.  It is a major ongoing source of death and injury as well as a major source of pollution, and bringing that era to a close is a special priority.  In the United States roughly 100 people per day die in car accidents, and many more are seriously injured, so you could say that every day we can accelerate the end of human driving saves a hundred lives.", "by": "dkarl"}, {"item_id": 21106773, "text": "&quot;You are still responsible for your car and must monitor it and its surroundings at times within your line of sight because it may not detect all obstacles.

I don&#x27;t get it.<p>I mean, if the summoned car came to me in a totally autonomous way, it would be useful in very large parking lots, like an airport, campus, etc... Or I could call it while still leaving my apartment&#x2F;office, and the car would be there by the time I get to the door.  But if I need to have the car in my line of sight, just standing still while watching it and holding the button, with me being aware and responsible of the car not bumping into any obstacle,  then it means I&#x27;m pretty close to the vehicle, so why not just walk the very short distance to it?", "by": "molmalo"}, {"item_id": 21106979, "text": "As a motorcyclist, these videos are sickening.
