[{"item_id": 21087388, "text": "I think if law enforcement uses these DNA databases then their entire department should be required to submit each officer\u2019s DNA and that of their immediate family members too. If prosecutors or defending attorneys want to use these databases, then the same should go for them. If a judge admits the use of DNA evidence for a case, then the same goes for them. Politicians by virtue passing these laws should get that same treatment.<p>Maybe the way to solve this issue is for law enforcement to be required to mail a letter to everyone who is in the database that they are a suspect in whatever crime being investigated each time law enforcement executed or delegates the execution of a search query. I mean that is how search works: you search everything or you compute hash functions on everything to avoid searching everything, but you\u2019ve effectively tested whether or not everyone in the database is the suspect.<p>On a slightly different topic, how well are these DNA databases secured and maintained? A person\u2019s DNA might not change, but the corresponding entry in the DNA database is subject to theft, manipulation, and data corruption. What\u2019s stopping the presumption of innocence until proven guilty becoming the presumption of innocence until the DNA database reports a match? Arguably, people should treat DNA  databases with the same level of suspicion and concern as some view electronic voting: absolutely vulnerable and absolutely abusable until repeatedly proven to be not sufficiently many times.", "by": "tareqak"}, {"item_id": 21088056, "text": "New Hampshire Public Radio put out an amazing podcast about a murder that went unsolved for decades.

I see these DNA database searches as an amazing tool to find criminals and not in any way privacy infringing. And I wish it was more widespread, ideally everyone being required to submit their DNA.<p>Some arguments I&#x27;m seeing:<p>* &quot;Privacy&quot;: I don&#x27;t see this more private than the information contained on a driver&#x27;s license. It also does not expose anything that&#x27;s not otherwise already available to the police. I don&#x27;t see the difference (when it comes to privacy) between DNA and a fingerprint that you have to provide when getting ID&#x2F;drivers license.<p>* &quot;False positives&quot;: Yes, they&#x27;ll probably happen. But even if we go with that assumption there are additional ways to exclude most of them. And those that can&#x27;t be excluded get tested for an exact match and&#x2F;or additional evidence. This is no different than being a suspect in any other way.<p>* &quot;False convictions&quot;: As far as I understood it this will just be used to narrow down potential suspects, not to get a conviction.<p>* &quot;Police will lie do anything to convict the person just based off of this evidence&quot;: That&#x27;s a separate topic that needs to be addressed, but not by reducing tools and forbidding technology that can narrow down and find suspects.<p>Under worst case scenario is being a false positive result and maybe talking to the police (if you were in the same city, your age was correct, you were around&#x2F;close to area of the crime) and providing exact DNA sample so much worse than the fact that &quot;The approach has led to arrests in at least 60 cold cases around the country.&quot;?

We already live in a world where law enforcement and the criminal justice system as a whole can be biased for or against different kinds of people depending on race, gender, background, sexual orientation, sexual identity, and wealth. If law enforcement is able to collect DNA samples and store the DNA of those who are convicted, then they could do statistical analysis on the genetic make-up of criminals by crime. Some people already have concerns about insurance companies getting access to their DNA and discriminating against them using increased prices or refusing to insure them all together. Similar analysis could be used by law enforcement and governments to monitor and apprehend people they suspect might have a higher probability commit a crime. Again, law enforcement already pulls over certain groups of people while they are out driving more often than others without repercussions.<p>Improper use of both DNA databases and statistical analysis can realistically be used to bring about the rise of something that I\u2019ve only ever read about: pre-crime.
