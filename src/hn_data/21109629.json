[{"item_id": 21110184, "text": "Interesting although I\u2019d love to see a discussion on the energy efficiencies as these catalyst aren\u2019t free.  CC (carbon carbon) and CH (carbon hydrogen) bonds are higher energy than CO (carbon oxygen) bonds. Hence why oxidizing (burning) carbon releases energy. You can\u2019t reverse that reaction without an energy source.<p>So maybe this process or a similar process could be driven from a sustainable non combustion source.<p>The entire global economy is powered by burning stuff and first we need to figure out how to change that (the advances in wind and solar give me hope) then we need to generate enough excess power that we can start converting CO bonds back into CC or CH bonds.", "by": "bognition"}]
