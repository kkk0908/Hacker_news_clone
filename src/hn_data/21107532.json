[{"item_id": 21108209, "text": "This product just seems... like a throwback to the first decade of this century.<p>A time when we rebelled against over-advertised, and over-priced Gillette Fusion cartridges.  Not by growing beards (that would come in the 2010&#x27;s).  But rather by shaving with $100 German double-edge razors, badger hair brushes, and artisial shaving soaps instead.<p>This here is a cheap pocket radio, like you could find at Walmart for $5.  Except that it is built to tune into only one frequency, it has no headphone jack, and its form-factor is a old-timey mason jar.  It&#x27;s &quot;artisanal&quot;, and &quot;locally-sourced&quot; and all that, and it does look like a pretty conversation piece.  But do people still gravitate to stuff like this?<p>I&#x27;m asking from genuine curiosity, because I&#x27;m not sure whether the &quot;hipster&quot; era faded away, or if it&#x27;s still there and I just grew a little too old?", "by": "StevePerkins"}, {"item_id": 21108157, "text": "The price is a good conversation about globalizing supply chains.<p>But what&#x27;s really cool is they have a way to program radios which are sealed inside a cardboard shipping box, without batteries installed.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wp.josh.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;capacitive-coupling-casestudy-programming-the-public-radio-without-removing-it-from-its-sealed-shipping-box&#x2F;\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;wp.josh.com&#x2F;2017&#x2F;03&#x2F;18&#x2F;capacitive-coupling-casestudy...</a>", "by": "imglorp"}, {"item_id": 21108714, "text": "The key part seems to be this:<p>&gt; In other words: We\u2019re making a piece of consumer electronics just-in-time in the US.<p>It is indeed hard to bring down costs that way, but when each unit needs to be individually programmed, as in this situation, this is a sensible way of doing it.<p>This is also a good way to do low volume production in general for hardware side-projects and the like. My own Relay (<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foundrytechnologies.com&#x2F;relay.php\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;foundrytechnologies.com&#x2F;relay.php</a>) is made in the same way - the components come from China but the assembly and firmware upload is done in the US.
