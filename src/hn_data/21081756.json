Segment&#x27;s product is fairly good but their pricing model is really bad. We recently ran into an issue where they were billing us for almost 10x the number of users we were actually tracking. It was a nightmare that required a few months of back and forth with their support trying to get it fixed. In the end, they gave us a partial refund for the overages but we had to do a lot of technical work to resolve the issue ourselves.<p>It would be nice to have an open source alternative that doesn&#x27;t get you locked into an unpredictable pricing model that you have very little control over.", "by": "vollmarj"}, {"item_id": 21098852, "text": "We are in the mobile game industry. Due to the incredible high volume events data per user generates per day, we need to join certain events together to reduce the events amount send to our analytics platform. There is no other segment tool can do this for us. We have been working with Rudder Labs to solve this problem. They have been really helpful and act super fast to our requests and suggestions. With Rudder Labs SDK, we are able to join event data on the platform(which we choose to host internally) + all other segment tool features. Besides that, since we run a freemium game so that most of our users are free users&#x2F;non-payers, cost is another thing we have to consider, current segment market pricing apparently is way too high for us.
