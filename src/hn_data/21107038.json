[{"item_id": 21107549, "text": "A big thing that annoys me about buzzwords like &quot;decentralized&quot; is that they&#x27;re not binary. Another one that&#x27;s largely lost meaning is &quot;blockchain&quot;. Decentralized is relative and depends entirely on the context.<p>They do tend to represent ideas like anti-censorship, individualism, and (sometimes) privacy. I think it makes more sense to discuss these topics in terms of the actual implication of what you&#x27;re decentralizing, and how it actually helps.<p>For example, the Internet itself is decentralized. But from the perspective of your particular ISP, it&#x27;s not at all decentralized (if your ISP turns off your Internet, it&#x27;s game over).<p>Email is also decentralized, but so what? Most people use the same email providers so it&#x27;s somewhat meaningless for SMTP itself to be decentralized. Google can still read your emails.<p>The problem with using these terms instead of more tangible language (i.e., language that describes what the thing is actually doing) is that they tend to get hijacked by scammers&#x2F;marketers who just want to harness their popularity for their own ends.", "by": "brenden2"}, {"item_id": 21109436, "text": "&gt; We need decentralized communication<p>&gt; Although Riot has made significant progress in the past few months, there is still a long way to go before it becomes a suitable drop-in replacement for platforms such as WhatsApp or Discord.<p>The problem with adoption client based on Matrix protocol is clearly lack of the quality of clients and being so annoying for users. I think it also stands true for other protocols like IRC or XMPP. In my humble opinion, clients for all 3 are far behind Telegram or WhatsApp or even BBM.<p>Looking on commits in repos of various Riot clients, I am not sure if there is significant progress (yes, it&#x27;s a bit unfair to said that, but comparing to let&#x27;s say webpack repository, number of random contributions is quite low). For Android there are two versions - Riot and RiotX. RiotX is in early stage development (I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s unusable), while the Riot just gets minor changes. iOS client is OK. Web and desktop client (based on electron) is not as simple as Slack to get start and running. I keep fingers crossed for Riot developers and spontaneous contributors to improve those clients - without good, simple to use clients there isn&#x27;t any chance for Matrix to be adopted widely as WhatsApp or Telegram are.<p>Centralization is not really important factor for most of people during selection of communicator. IM is a tool and if it does not do its job properly, people will look for better alternatives. Just, please take a look how many sysadmins&#x2F;devops switched to Slack from IRC. Please stop writing yet another article how centralization is bad - just help Vector.im, TheLounge.chat or other group to bring such IM client where most of people will be comfortable to use it.", "by": "piotrkubisa"}, {"item_id": 21107791, "text": "<a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KbWfzyQBWrU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=KbWfzyQBWrU</a><p>&gt; Most Popular Instant Messengers 1997 - 2019<p>WhatsApp has approx. 2 billion users.
