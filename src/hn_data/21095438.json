While I agree that #3 deserves criticism, I feel like #6 (Tell me about your preferred workday) and #8 (Describe your preferred relationship with coworkers) are even more problematic. As an introvert, as someone who likes quiet, my ideal workday consists of me getting into work at ~7:30am, working until ~4:30pm with about an hour off for lunch.

And yet, if I actually gave that response to question #6, the <i>best</i> I could hope for is a sympathetic nod from my interviewer, and a mention about how they attempt to have a single day without meetings. Instead, I feel like I&#x27;m supposed to lie about how I like &quot;collaboration&quot; (code for meetings).<p>#8 (Describe your preferred relationship with coworkers) is, if anything, even worse.
