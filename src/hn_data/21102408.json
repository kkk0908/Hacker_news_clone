And then when a blue-ribbon panel of Boeing employees went to find out what happened, their findings were buried and no corrective action was taken. 737 NG&#x27;s are flying around with substandard critical structural components like spars and the areas around doors, leading to several fuselage breakups on hard landings and runway overruns, which has killed at least several passengers to date. In past similar incidents, aircraft fuselages survived intact. There&#x27;s a very real possibility that one or more 737 NG&#x27;s may breakup in heavy turbulence, hard landings and runway overruns at any time, and Boeing knows about it, but has done nothing to remedy it.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IaWdEtANi-0\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;youtu.be&#x2F;IaWdEtANi-0</a>", "by": "anon91831837"}, {"item_id": 21102820, "text": "I\u2019m not flying anymore.
