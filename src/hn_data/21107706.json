There are errors in very new or very obscure material, but those tend to get corrected as more people start paying attention to them.  It therefore seems like the search should therefore be concentrated in recent results that are becoming more useful but still aren&#x27;t standard.<p>On the other hand, we do need to build a standard library of results that can be used to prove those newer results.
