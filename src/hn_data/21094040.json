Getting blocked, censored, &#x27;down\\voted&#x27; etc. These people are extremely wealthy and throw money to anyone who will help them cover up their child rapes &amp;murders, corruption. Ironically\\, this is usually done through a receivership transfer where you receive the funds after for or more day, and it can be pulled at the last second, which is usually the case after you&#x27;ve done them the &quot;service&quot; as they call it.\nA word about the &quot;f@\\#&amp;ot&quot; usage: it was a necessary tool. It showed three things: they were not in control, if they were the usage would have been stopped. Everyone out there needed to see this. Two, it made it unpleasant for them to be in the head space, which has obvious advantages. Three it pointed out impersonators of B.S. because they would not call each other f@\\%ot, thus helping to mitigate the spread of false information. Apologies for those unintentionally offended.
