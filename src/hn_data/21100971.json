You have an equilateral triangle inscribed in a circle. You pick a random chord from the circle (a line that goes from one edge of the circle to another). What&#x27;s the probability the chord is longer than an edge of the triangle?<p>As it turns out, there isn&#x27;t a well-defined solution. That&#x27;s the paradox. The issue comes from &quot;picking a random chord&quot;. There are different ways that you can pick a random chord which lead to different solutions. One approach to picking a random chord is to pick two random points on the circle and draw the chord between them. This gives you a probability of 1&#x2F;3. Another approach is to pick a random direction and radius, then draw a chord at the end of the radius perpendicular to the radius. This approach gives you a probability of 1&#x2F;2.<p>One interesting aspect is the second approach is the only approach where if you were to draw a circle within the larger circle, the distribution of the chords in the inner circle will match the distribution of chords in the outer circle.<p>[0] <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bertrand_paradox_(probability)\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Bertrand_paradox_(probability)</a>", "by": "malisper"}, {"item_id": 21102154, "text": "I thought this was total magic in high school until my college&#x27;s intro to probability class discussed this before the midterm.
